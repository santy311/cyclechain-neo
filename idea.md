# CycleChain: Blockchain-Based Bicycle Authentication & Tracking System

## Overview

CycleChain is a decentralized application built on the Neo blockchain that provides an immutable and transparent system for bicycle registration, ownership tracking, and theft prevention. By creating digital twins of physical bicycles, we enable secure ownership verification and maintenance tracking throughout a bicycle's lifecycle.

## Problem Statement

- Global bicycle theft is a significant issue, with millions of bikes stolen annually
- Lack of standardized verification methods in the used bicycle market
- Difficulty in verifying maintenance history and component authenticity
- Challenge in tracking stolen bikes across jurisdictions
- No unified system for manufacturers, retailers, and owners

## Solution

CycleChain creates a comprehensive ecosystem where each bicycle has a digital identity on the blockchain, enabling:

- Manufacturer registration of new bicycles
- Secure ownership transfers
- Maintenance history tracking
- Stolen bicycle reporting and tracking
- Component change verification

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. Smart Contracts

   - Bicycle Registration Contract
   - Ownership Management Contract
   - Maintenance Record Contract
   - Theft Registry Contract

2. User Interfaces

   - Manufacturer Portal
   - Service Provider Dashboard
   - Owner Mobile App
   - Law Enforcement Interface

3. Integration Layer
   - API Gateway
   - Event Listeners
   - External Service Connectors

## Sequence Diagrams

### 1. Bicycle Registration Process

    participant M as Manufacturer
    participant SC as Smart Contract
    participant BC as Blockchain

    M->>SC: Register New Bicycle(frameNumber, details)
    SC->>BC: Verify Manufacturer Authority
    BC->>SC: Authority Confirmed
    SC->>BC: Create Digital Twin
    BC->>SC: Confirm Creation
    SC->>M: Registration Confirmation
    Note over M,BC: Digital Certificate Generated
```

### 2. Ownership Transfer Process

```mermaid

    participant S as Seller
    participant SC as Smart Contract
    participant B as Buyer
    participant BC as Blockchain

    S->>SC: Initiate Transfer(frameNumber, buyerAddress)
    SC->>BC: Verify Current Ownership
    BC->>SC: Ownership Confirmed
    SC->>B: Transfer Notification
    B->>SC: Accept Transfer
    SC->>BC: Update Ownership
    BC->>SC: Confirm Update
    SC->>S: Transfer Complete
    SC->>B: Ownership Confirmed
```

### 3. Maintenance Recording Process

```mermaid

    participant SP as Service Provider
    participant SC as Smart Contract
    participant BC as Blockchain
    participant O as Owner

    SP->>SC: Record Maintenance(frameNumber, details)
    SC->>BC: Verify Service Provider Authority
    BC->>SC: Authority Confirmed
    SC->>BC: Add Maintenance Record
    BC->>SC: Confirm Record
    SC->>SP: Recording Complete
    SC->>O: Maintenance Notification
```

### 4. Theft Reporting Process

```mermaid

    participant O as Owner
    participant SC as Smart Contract
    participant BC as Blockchain
    participant LE as Law Enforcement

    O->>SC: Report Stolen(frameNumber)
    SC->>BC: Verify Ownership
    BC->>SC: Ownership Confirmed
    SC->>BC: Mark as Stolen
    BC->>SC: Update Confirmed
    SC->>O: Report Confirmation
    SC->>LE: Theft Notification
```

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Functions

```solidity
// Core functions in the smart contract
function registerBicycle(string frameNumber, BicycleDetails details)
function transferOwnership(string frameNumber, address newOwner)
function recordMaintenance(string frameNumber, MaintenanceDetails details)
function reportStolen(string frameNumber)
function verifyOwnership(string frameNumber) returns (OwnershipDetails)
```

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Bicycle {
    string frameNumber;
    string manufacturer;
    string model;
    uint256 manufactureDate;
    address currentOwner;
    bool isStolen;
    MaintenanceRecord[] maintenanceHistory;
    ComponentChange[] componentHistory;
}
```
